4. Set Domain Password Policy to a minimum of 14 characters, with a 90 days expiration age and with a minimum of one day before user can change password. Every time a user resets their password, the last 12 passwords are remembered meaning they can’t re-use old passwords. Users have 5 attempts to enter correct password before account locks. After account is locked, users can re-try to login after 30 minutes. Passwords must contain upper case, lower case and symbols.

5. Set Fine-Grained Password Policies for specific groups in Finance, HR and IT. This means that The Finance-Approvers, HR-Managers and Developers in the OU follow a different password policy from the rest of the domain.

Created three Group Object Policies for Corporate-HQ OU, a screen lock policy, a USB restriction policy and a control panel restriction policy. In this lab WMI filters were not used.

Screen lock policy: Forces the screensaver to activate after 10 minutes, and this forces the screen to lock, requiring the user log in again to prevent unauthorized access. 

USB Restriction policy: Disables USB storage devices to prevent standard users from copying sensitive data or introducing malware. 

Control panel restriction policy: Prevents standard users from changing system settings, uninstalling, network configurations or uninstalling software.
